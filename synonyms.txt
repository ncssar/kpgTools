# synonyms.txt for Nevada County Sheriff's Search and Rescue
#  modify this file as needed for your own team
# This file defines legal channel name synonyms for use in kpgCheck.py.
#  (channel names are already compared case-insensitively in kpgCheck.py,
#   so "Chan" matches "CHAN" without needing to define them as synonyms here)
# Use one line per legal synonym set of two or more synonyms.
# In each line, channel names must be in double quotes, separated by space.
# EXAMPLE:
# "MyChannel" "My Channel" "MYCHAN"
"CDF NEU West" "CDF W Tone 4"
"NCFire Tone 4" "Nev.CO Fire "
"NASAR" "VSAR16"
"SAR SGL" "PCSAR SIGNAL"
